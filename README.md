# Designing for Sustainable Urban Mobility Review
Urban mobility poses as one of the pressing challenges in cities undergoing growing urbanisation, exerting ample influence on the quality of life. In order to cope with this issue, a shift in behaviour is necessary, from the private passenger car towards more sustainable means of transportation. Technology can mediate the process of behaviour change, and concepts such as persuasive technology and reflective learning are approaches in this context.

In order to investigate currently envisioned or implemented technological solutions, particular in the context of the smart city notion, a systematic literature review was conducted. Three areas are thereby of particular interest: the utilised technological solution, behaviour change strategies, and citizen participation in the design and development process of the interventions.

A total of 15 studies were included in the final review, discussing 14 different applications. The findings show that mobile devices are being prevalently used, persuasive strategies are foremost mentioned as guiding behaviour change, and end-user involvement is happening late in the development process and serves primarily testing purposes.

This points out that there are still various unexplored possibilities in the aforementioned areas. It is suggested that future research should explore opportunities stemming from ubiquitous technology, employ behaviour change strategies grounded in reflective learning, and approach the current shortcomings in citizen involvement with participatory methods.
